    <li>2 (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <strong>Step 1</strong>
  <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
  <strong>Step 2</strong>
  <p>
    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles and
    cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and rinse with cold water.
  </p>
  <strong>Step 3</strong>
  <p>
    Meanwhile, melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; stir in onion
    and garlic. Whisk in flour until lightly browned and onion is tender, about
    2 minutes. Add chicken broth, milk, and salt; cook, whisking continuously,
    for 1 minute.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stir in 2 cups mozzarella and 1/4 cup Parmesan until well combined. Season

    Spread 1/3 of the sauce mixture in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.
    Layer with 3 lasagna noodles, ricotta, and chicken. Arrange 3 lasagna
    noodles over the chicken and layer with 1/3 of the sauce mixture, spinach,
    remaining 2 cups mozzarella, and 1/2 cup Parmesan. Arrange remaining noodles
    over cheese and spread remaining sauce evenly over noodles. Sprinkle with
    parsley and remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan.
